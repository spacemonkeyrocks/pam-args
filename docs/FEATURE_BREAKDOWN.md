## Notes on Refined Modular Organization

- **Organizational Improvements**: The refined breakdown splits larger features into more focused components, improving maintainability and testability.

- **Multi-Stage Parser Split**: The original "Multi-Stage Parser" has been split into several components:
  - Input Tokenizer and Syntax Validator
  - Bracket Content Processor
  - Flag Argument Processor
  - Key-Value Definition System
  - Key-Value Parsing Logic
  - Dynamic Key-Value Handler
  - Non-Argument Text Collector

- **Validation Engine Split**: The validation functionality has been divided into:
  - Basic Validation System (for required args and allowed values)
  - Relational Validation System (for dependencies and exclusions)

- **Field Binding Split**: The field binding feature has been split into:
  - Field Reference Management (for safe reference handling)
  - Type Conversion & Field Updates (for type conversion and field updates)

- **Derive Macro Split**: The derive macro functionality has been divided into:
  - Struct Analysis
  - Parser Generation
  - Field Binding Generation
  - Derive Macro Integration

- **Module System**: The refined organization uses a more hierarchical module structure:
  - `src/parser/` for parsing components
  - `src/validation/` for validation components
  - `src/binding/` for field binding components
  - `src/storage/` for storage components
  - `pam-args-derive/src/` for derive macro components

- **Implementation Order**: The implementation order follows dependencies, starting with core components and moving to more specialized features.

- **Testing Approach**: Each component has a clear testing strategy, with unit tests for focused functionality and integration tests for component interactions.

This refined modular approach ensures the codebase remains maintainable, testable, and easy to understand as it evolves, with each component having a clear, focused responsibility.
